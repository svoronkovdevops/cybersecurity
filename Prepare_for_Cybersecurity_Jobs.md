## Data and asset classification

Protecting an organization’s business operations and assets from security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities is important. You previously learned what it means to have a security mindset. That mindset can help you identify and reduce security risks and potential incidents.
In this reading, you will learn about key data classification types and the difference between the low-level and high-level assets of an organization.

### Classifying for safety

Security professionals classify data types to help them properly protect an organization from cyber attacks that negatively impact business operations. Here is a review of the most common data types:
    • Public data
    • Private data
    • Sensitive data
    • Confidential data

#### Public data

This data classification does not need extra security protections. Public data is already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others. Although this data is open to the public, it still needs to be protected from security attacks. Examples of public data include press releases, job descriptions, and marketing materials.

#### Private data

This data classification type has a higher security level. Private data is information that should be kept from the public. If an individual gains unauthorized access to private data, that event has the potential to pose a serious risk to an organization. 
Examples of private data can include company email addresses, employee identification numbers, and an organization’s research data. 

#### Sensitive data

This information must be protected from everyone who does not have authorized access. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can cause significant damage to an organization’s finances and reputation. 
Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII), and protected health information (PHI). Examples of these types of sensitive data are banking account numbers, usernames and passwords, social security numbers (which U.S. citizens use to report their wages to the government), passwords, passport numbers, and medical information. 

#### Confidential data

This data classification type is important for an organization’s ongoing business operations. Confidential data often has limits on the number of people who have access to it. Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)— legal contracts that bind two or more parties to protect information—to further protect the confidentiality of the data. 
Examples of confidential data include proprietary information such as trade secrets, financial records, and sensitive government data.

#### Asset classification

Asset classification means labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. The classification of an organization's assets ranges from low- to high-level. 
Public data is a low-level asset. It is readily available to the public and will not have a negative impact on an organization if compromised. Sensitive data and confidential data are high-level assets. They can have a significantly negative impact on an organization if leaked publicly. That negative impact can lead to the loss of a company’s competitive edge, reputation, and customer trust. A company’s website address is an example of a low-level asset. An internal email from that company discussing trade secrets is an example of a high-level asset.

## Disaster recovery and business continuity

The role of a security professional is to ensure a company’s data and assets are protected from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. However, sometimes things don’t go as planned. There are times when security incidents happen. You’ve already learned that security breaches can lead to financial consequences and the loss of credibility with customers or other businesses in the industry. 
This reading will discuss the need to create business continuity and disaster recovery plans to minimize the impact of a security incident on an organization’s business operations. Analysts need to consider the sequence of steps to be taken by the security team before business continuity and disaster recovery plans are implemented.  

### Identify and protect

Creating business continuity and disaster recovery plans are the final steps of a four-part process that most security teams go through to help ensure the security of an organization. 
First, the security team identifies the assets that must be protected in the organization. Next, they determine what potential threats could negatively impact those assets. After the threats have been determined, the security team implements tools and processes to detect potential threats to assets. Lastly, the IT or appropriate business function creates the business continuity and disaster recovery plans. These plans are created in conjunction with one another. The plans help to minimize the impact of a security incident involving one of the organization’s assets.

### Business continuity plan

The impact of successful security attacks on an organization can be significant. Loss of profits and customers are two possible outcomes that organizations never want to happen. A business continuity plan is a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. It is created alongside a disaster recovery plan to minimize the damage of a successful security attack. Here are four essential steps for business continuity plans:
    • Conduct a business impact analysis. The business impact analysis step focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization. 
    • Identify, document, and implement steps to recover critical business functions and processes. This step helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event.
    • Organize a business continuity team. This step brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan, if it is needed. The members of this team are typically from the cybersecurity,  IT, HR, communications, and operations departments. 
    • Conduct training for the business continuity team. The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during these training exercises. 

### Disaster recovery plan

A disaster recovery plan allows an organization’s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:
    • Implementing recovery strategies to restore software
    • Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality
    • Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident has taken place

## Juliana's story: Asset protection

Meet Juliana Soto, who recently completed an online cybersecurity certificate program and was hired as a cybersecurity analyst for Right-On-Time Payment Solutions, a fictional payment processing company allowing individuals to transfer money to friends and family. Right-On-Time also allows companies to accept payments from customers or organizations. 
In this reading, you will begin a three-part journey that follows Juliana as she takes on new roles and responsibilities within the cybersecurity team of her new company. 
Juliana decides that one of her first objectives is to gain a better understanding of the most important assets to the company by reviewing various company reading materials that will help her learn what is most valuable to them. On her first day, she is given reading materials to help her familiarize herself with the company. She learns that customers must create unique usernames and passwords and provide their full name or company name to sign up for the service as an individual. Business customers can also sign up for the service if they provide their employee identification number (EIN). Finally, customers must enter their bank account information or debit card number for payments to be accepted. 
Juliana discovers that this company handles a lot of personally identifiable information (PII) from its customers. This kind of information is considered sensitive data. Unauthorized access to it can lead to significant damage to the organization’s finances, its customers, and its reputation. Juliana realizes that the most important asset to this company is customer data. 
After finishing the required onboarding materials, she decides to put together an information lifecycle strategy. She learned about this when completing her online cybersecurity certificate program. 

### Information lifecycle strategy

Juliana recalls the following steps of the information lifecycle:
    • The first step in the information lifecycle is to identify the important assets to the company, including sensitive customer information such as PII, financial information, social security numbers, and EINs. 
    • The second step is to assess the security measures in place to protect the identified assets and review the company’s information security policies. There are different components to this step, ranging from vulnerability scanning to reviewing processes and procedures that are already in place. Juliana is new to the company and might not be ready to conduct vulnerability scans. 
    • The third step of the information lifecycle is to protect the identified assets of the organization. Once again, this is only Juliana’s first day on the job. She asks her supervisor if she can observe a more senior security analyst for a day. This will give her the opportunity to learn how the security team monitors the company’s systems and network.
    • The last step of the security lifecycle is to monitor the security processes that have been implemented to protect the organization’s assets. She contacts her supervisor and gives them a detailed report of what she has learned on her first day. She requests to finish her day by monitoring a few of the systems that are in place. Her supervisor is impressed with her initiative and prepares Juliana to monitor the security systems. What a great first day for Juliana!

## Escalate with a purpose

You previously learned about security incident escalation and the skills needed to help you escalate incidents. In this reading, you’ll learn the importance of escalating security issues and the potential impact of failing to escalate an issue. 

### Incident escalation

Security incident escalation is the process of identifying a potential security incident. During this process, potential incidents are transferred to a more experienced department or team member. As a security analyst, you’ll be expected to recognize potential issues, such as when an employee excessively enters the wrong credentials to their account, and report it to the appropriate person. When you join a new organization, you’ll learn about the specific processes and procedures for escalating incidents.  

### Notification of breaches

Many countries have breach notification laws, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the laws applicable in the area your company is operating in. Breach notification laws require companies and government entities to notify individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII). PII includes identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, etc.), personal medical records, addresses, and other sensitive customer information. As an entry-level security analyst, you’ll need to be aware of various security laws, especially because they are regularly updated.

### Low-level security issues

Low-level security issues are security risks that do not result in the exposure of PII. These issues can include the following and other risks:
    • An employee having one failed login attempt on their account
    • An employee downloading unapproved software onto their work laptop 
These issues are not significant security challenges, but they must be investigated further in case they need to be escalated. An employee typing in a password two to three times might not be of concern. But if that employee types in a password 15 times within 30 minutes, there might be an issue that needs to be escalated. What if the multiple failed login attempts were a malicious actor attempting to compromise an employee’s account? What if an employee downloads an internet game or software on their work laptop that is infected with malware? You previously learned that malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. If malware is downloaded onto an organization’s network, it can lead to financial loss and even loss of reputation with the organization’s customers. While low-level security issues are not considered significant security threats, they should still be investigated to ensure they result in minimal impact to the organization.

### The escalation process

Every company has different protocols and procedures, including unique escalation policies. These policies detail who should be notified when a security alert is received and who should be contacted if the first responder is not available. The policy will also determine how someone should specifically escalate an incident, whether it’s via the IT desk, an incident management tool, or direct communication between security team members.niques to exfiltrate data, should you like to learn more, check out data exfiltration techniques - MITRE ATT&CK®

## Recognize roles and responsibilities during escalation

You previously learned about various incident classification types and how those incidents can impact an organization. 
This reading will discuss the roles of the various team members who are a part of the incident escalation process. Keep in mind that not all organizations are alike, and some roles and responsibilities may be identified using different terminology and definitions.  

### Data owners

A data owner is the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, access, and use of company data. For example, consider a situation where an employee gains unauthorized access to software they do not need to use for work. This kind of security event would be escalated to the data owner of that software.

### Data controllers

Data controllers determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. This role largely focuses on collecting the personal information of customers. The data controller determines how that data is used. The data controller also ensures that data is used, stored, and processed in accordance with relevant security and privacy regulations. If sensitive customer information was at risk, that event would be escalated to data controllers.

### Data processors

Data processors report directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is typically a vendor and is often tasked with installing security measures to help protect the data. Data processing issues are typically escalated to the individual who oversees the third-party organization responsible for data processing.

### Data custodians

Data custodians assign and remove access to software or hardware. Custodians are responsible for implementing security controls for the data they are responsible for, granting and revoking access to that data, creating policies regarding how that data is stored and transmitted, advising on potential threats to that data, and monitoring the data. Data custodians are notified when data security controls need to be strengthened or have been compromised.

### Data protection officers (DPOs)

Data protection officers are responsible for monitoring the internal compliance of an organization’s data protection procedures. These individuals advise the security team on the obligations required by the organization's data protection standards and procedures. They also conduct assessments to determine whether or not the security measures in place are properly protecting the data as necessary. DPOs are notified when set standards or protocols have been violated.

## Escalation timing

You previously learned about the potential impact even the smallest incident can have on an organization if the incident is not escalated properly. You also discovered just how important your role as an entry-level analyst will be to the effectiveness of an organization’s escalation process. 
This reading will go into more detail about the role you’ll play in protecting an organization’s data and assets when it comes to escalating incidents.   

### Your decisions matter

Security is a fast-paced environment with bad actors constantly trying to compromise an organization’s systems and data. This means security analysts must be prepared to make daily decisions to help keep a company’s data and systems safe. Entry-level security analysts help the security team escalate potential security incidents to the right team members. A big part of your role as a security analyst will be making decisions about which security events to escalate before they become major security incidents.

### Trust your instincts and ask questions

Confidence is an important attribute for a security analyst to have, especially when it comes to the escalation process. The security team will depend on you to be confident in your decision-making. You should be intentional about learning the organization’s escalation policy. This will help you gain confidence in making the right decisions when it comes to escalating security events. But remember to ask questions when necessary. It shows that you’re committed to constantly learning the right way to do your job. 

### All security events are not equal

An important part of escalation is recognizing which assets and data are the most important for your organization. You can determine this information by reading through your onboarding materials, asking your supervisor directly about which assets and data are most important, and reviewing your company’s security policies. When you have that type of understanding, it allows you to recognize when one incident should be given a higher priority over others. You previously learned about the following incident classification types:
    • Malware infections: Occur when malicious software designed to disrupt a system infiltrates an organization’s computers or network
    • Unauthorized access: Occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system, data,  or application without permission 
    • Improper usage: Occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization’s acceptable use policies
Identifying a specific incident type allows you to properly prioritize and quickly escalate those incidents. Remember, an incident which directly impacts assets that are essential to business operations should always take priority over incidents that do not directly impact business operations. For example, an incident where unauthorized access has been gained to a manufacturing application should take priority over an incident where malware has infected a legacy system that does not impact business operations. As you gain experience in the cybersecurity field, you will learn how to quickly assess the priority levels of incident types. 

### Quick escalation tips

A big part of your role in cybersecurity will be determining when to escalate a security event. Here are a few tips to help with this:
    • Familiarize yourself with the escalation policy of the organization you work for.
    • Follow the policy at all times.
    • Ask questions.

## Juliana's story: Attention to detail

This is the second reading in the scenario about Juliana Soto, a cybersecurity analyst who was recently hired by Right-On-Time Payment Solutions. In the reading about asset protection, Juliana identified important assets to her organization and came up with a plan for how to protect them. In this reading, you will review how Juliana used her company’s escalation policy and her attention to detail to deal with security issues she encountered on the job. 

### Focus on the details
As she prepares to go into the office this morning, Juliana reflects on the previous day’s accomplishments: 
    • Read through company information to learn about the most important assets she is tasked with protecting
    • Learned that her company deals with PII data from customers
    • Put together an information security lifecycle strategy for the organization’s data
    • Began monitoring security systems on her work laptop
It was an exciting first day full of new information for Juliana! She wonders what today will bring.
Juliana is at her desk monitoring data logs and responding to emails. Suddenly, her system alerts her of suspicious log activity. It appears that an employee’s account has been locked due to 10 failed login attempts. She finds this concerning because the escalation policy states that 10 failed login attempts should be escalated to the password protection team.  
Juliana is excited about her first chance to escalate a security event. As she prepares to go through the escalation process, she is suddenly alerted to another event that has happened. She clicks on the alert and learns that an unknown source has attempted to compromise a system that stores bank account information for the company’s customers. She views this as a major concern. She recalls the importance of sensitive financial information from her previous security training. She learned the previous day that her company stores a large amount of sensitive customer data. Hundreds of customers will be impacted if a system storing this kind of important data is compromised. 
Juliana decides that the unknown source attempting to compromise the system that stores the bank information of customers is the more urgent of the two events and needs to be handled immediately. She references the company’s escalation policy to find the best way to handle the escalation process for this type of incident. 
Juliana carefully follows the process outlined in the escalation policy, making sure to be attentive to all of the details in the process. This allows her to notify the appropriate team members of what has happened. She completes all the steps outlined in the escalation policy for an event dealing with customer PII. 
Next, she decides to escalate the lower-priority event. Once again, she follows the company guidelines to escalate that event. 
Juliana’s supervisor is impressed with her initiative and ability to follow the escalation guidelines. Juliana is off to a great start in her security career!

## The purpose and impact of stakeholders

You previously learned about incident escalation and the various security incident classification types. You also learned about the impact these incidents can have on an organization’s business operations.
This reading will explore the individuals who have a significant interest in those business operations: stakeholders. 

### Who are stakeholders?

A stakeholder is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization. A big part of what you’ll do as a security analyst is report your findings to various security stakeholders. 

### Levels of stakeholders

There are many levels of stakeholders within larger organizations. As an entry-level analyst, you might only communicate directly with a few of them. Although you might not communicate with all of the security stakeholders in an organization, it’s important to have an understanding of who key stakeholders are:
    • A Chief Information Security Officer, also known as the CISO, is the highest level of security stakeholder. You are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst. 
    • A Chief Financial Officer, also known as the CFO, is another high-level stakeholder that you’re unlikely to communicate with directly.
    • An operations manager oversees the day-to-day security operations. These individuals lead teams related to the development and implementation of security strategies that protect an organization from cyber threats.
    • A cybersecurity risk manager is a professional responsible for leading efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within an organization.
CFOs and CISOs are focused on the big picture, like the potential financial burden of a security incident, whereas other roles like operations managers are more focused on the impact on day-to-day operations. Although you will rarely interact directly with high-level security stakeholders, it’s still important to recognize their relevance.

### Stakeholder communications for entry-level analysts

Two examples of security stakeholders with whom you might regularly communicate are operations managers and risk managers. When you report to these stakeholders, you'll need to clearly communicate the current security issue and its possible causes. The operations managers will then determine next steps and coordinate other team members to remediate or resolve the issue. 
For example, you might report multiple failed login attempts by an employee to your operations manager. This stakeholder might contact the employee’s supervisor to ensure the occurrence is a genuine issue of entering the wrong password or determine if the account has been compromised. The stakeholder and supervisor might also need to discuss the consequences for day-to-day operations if genuine failed login attempts can lead to account lockouts that might impact business operations. As an entry-level security analyst, you might play a role in implementing preventative measures once next steps have been determined.

### From one stakeholder to the next

Operations managers and risk managers are stakeholders who rely on entry-level analysts and other team members to keep them informed of security events in day-to-day operations. These stakeholders commonly report back to the CISOs and CFOs to give a broader narrative of the organization's overall security picture. Although you won't regularly communicate with high-level stakeholders, it's important to recognize that your efforts still reach the highest levels of security stakeholders in the organization. These other members of your team keep those top-level stakeholders informed on the security measures and protocols in place that are continuously helping to protect the organization.

### Roles


The `risk manager `helps to identify risks and manage the response to cybersecurity threats. They may also develop, implement, and enforce IT policies that employees must follow.

The `Chief Executive Officer (CEO) `is the highest ranking person in an organization. They are responsible for financial and managerial decisions and reporting to shareholders. Because of this, they are concerned with the financial and operational impacts of incidents.

The `operations manager `often works with security analysts as the first line of defense in protecting the company from security incidents. They are often responsible for daily maintenance of security operations and are essential when it comes to security response.

The `legal counsel `tracks applicable litigation and provides legal advice to the organization. To track litigation, they follow new and changing security legislation and regulations. They may also help address loss of secured data, legal penalties, and regulatory fines.

The `Chief Financial Officer (CFO) `is concerned about security from a financial standpoint, including the potential costs of an incident. They are also interested in the costs of the tools and strategies necessary to combat security incidents.

The `Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) `is a high-level executive responsible for developing an organization’s security architecture and conducting risk analysis and system audits. CISOs are also tasked with creating security and business continuity plans.

## Communicate effectively with stakeholders

You previously learned about security stakeholders and their significance in an organization. In this reading, you’ll learn the importance of clearly communicating to stakeholders to ensure they have a thorough understanding of the information you’re sharing and why it’s meaningful to the organization. 

### Get to the point

Security stakeholders have roles and responsibilities that are time sensitive and impact the business. It’s important that any communications they receive, and the actions they need to take, are clear. To get to the point in your communications, ask yourself: 
    • What do I want this person to know? 
    • Why is it important for them to know it? 
    • When do they need to take action?
    • How do I explain the situation in a nontechnical manner?

### Follow the protocols

When you first join a security team, you’ll want to learn about the different protocols and procedures in place for communicating with stakeholders and other members of the organization. It’s important to make sure you know what applications and forms of communications are acceptable before you begin communicating with stakeholders, such as in-person meetings, video-conferencing, emails, or company chat applications.

### Communicate with impact

You previously learned about the different stakeholders within an organization and what specific areas they’re focused on. When you first begin your career in the cybersecurity field, you're more likely to interact with lower-level stakeholders, like operations managers or security risk managers, who are interested in the day-to-day operations, such as logging. Senior-level stakeholders might be more interested in the underlying risks, such as the potential financial burden of a security incident—as opposed to the details around logs. 
When you communicate with an operations manager, make sure you address relevant information that relates to their daily responsibilities, such as anomalies in data logs that you are escalating. Concentrating on a manager’s daily responsibilities will help you communicate the need-to-know information to that individual. 

### Communication methods

Your method of communication will vary, depending on the type of information you’re sharing. Knowing which communication channels are appropriate for different scenarios is a great skill to help you communicate effectively with stakeholders. Here are a few ways you might choose to communicate:
    • Instant messaging
    • Emailing
    • Video calling
    • Phone calls
    • Sharing a spreadsheet of data
    • Sharing a slideshow presentation 
If your message is straightforward, an instant message or phone call might be the route to take. If you have to describe a complex situation with multiple layers, an email or in-person meeting might be the better option. If you’re providing a lot of data and numbers, sharing a graph might be the best solution. Each situation helps you determine the best means of communication.

## Create visual dashboards for impactful cybersecurity communications

You previously learned about security stakeholders, the people responsible for protecting the data and systems of various departments of an organization. An entry-level analyst might communicate directly or indirectly with these individuals. If you do end up communicating with a stakeholder, it’s important to use the right method of communication. This reading will further elaborate on the significance of using visual dashboards to communicate information to stakeholders. Dashboards can include charts, graphs, and even infographics. You’ll learn more about when to use visual communication strategies in this reading. 

### Using visuals to communicate effectively

Security is about protecting a company from threats that can affect its reputation and finances. Oftentimes, responding to threats quickly and effectively depends on clear communications between the stakeholders who are involved.
In the cybersecurity field, the stakeholders you'll deal with will often be busy with other responsibilities. Showing them important information visually is a great way to gain their input and support to address security challenges that arise. Visuals help provide these decision-makers with actionable information that can help them identify potential risks to the organization's security posture.

### Visual dashboards

A visual dashboard is a way of displaying various types of data quickly in one place. Visual dashboards are useful tools that can be used to communicate stories to stakeholders about security events—especially when they involve numbers and data.
Dashboards can be simple or complex depending on the information you're communicating. A simple dashboard might contain a single chart, while a complex one can include multiple detailed charts, graphs, and tables. Deciding which type to use will depend on the situation and story you are telling. However, attention to detail and accurately representing information is important anytime you're communicating data to stakeholders.
Pro tip: Programs like Google Sheets and Apache OpenOffice are tools that can be used to create visual dashboards.

### When to use visual communication

Security is often a team effort. Everyone must work together to ensure an organization is properly protected from bad actors. Knowing how to communicate with your colleagues is a big part of the team-focused aspect. 
Sometimes it’s enough to send a simple email update. Other times you might want to include a document attachment that further elaborates on a specific topic. A simple phone call can also be valuable because it allows you to quickly communicate the necessary information without having to wait for a response to an email or message. Other times, the best way to communicate is through visuals. 
For example, consider a situation where your supervisor has asked you to provide them with results from a recent internal audit of five different departments within the organization. The audit gathered data showing how many phishing emails each department clicked over the last five months. This is an ideal opportunity to tell this story using visualization tools. Instead of sending an email that simply describes what the findings are, a graph or chart will clearly illustrate those findings, making them easier for the stakeholder to understand quickly and easily.

## Juliana’s story: Effective communication

Throughout this course, you’ve been following the story of Juliana Soto. Juliana was recently hired as a cybersecurity analyst by Right-On-Time Payment Solutions, a payment processing company that handles sensitive customer information. In the reading about attention to detail, Juliana had to deal with two different types of security incidents, and she used her company’s escalation policy to properly escalate the two incidents. Now you will review how Juliana handled communication with stakeholders after escalating the incidents.

### Communicating with stakeholders after an incident

Days after escalating the two incidents, Juliana’s manager asks her to communicate information about the incidents to stakeholders. 

### Communicating about incident #1

One of the incidents dealt with an employee being locked out of their account due to multiple failed login attempts. Juliana’s manager was recently asked to provide a report that reviews how many departments have experienced locked employee accounts due to failed login attempts over the last month. The security team shared data that details the number of locked employee accounts due to multiple failed login attempts from five different departments.
Juliana’s manager will report the information to the senior executives of each of the five departments. The manager asks Juliana to display the data in a way that communicates the incident clearly to these stakeholders. For this task, Juliana decides to put together a visual dashboard to represent the data because the communication is primarily focused on numbers. Her dashboard will use charts and graphs to relay important information, like the number of  employees who have been locked out of their accounts in the last month. Juliana's visual dashboard makes it easier for the high-level stakeholders to review incident #1 and determine a course of action. 

### Communicating about incident #2

Juliana’s manager has also been informed that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) wants more information about what took place during the second incident, which involved an attacker almost compromising a system that stores customers’ private data. This communication will include a more detailed report that establishes what processes and procedures worked well during attackers' attempts to compromise the system and what processes and procedures might need to be revised. Because this is a more detailed communication, Juliana decides to put together a detailed document with timelines that clearly explain what happened. The document also includes her thoughts on what the security team, data owners, and data processors could have done differently to protect the system in question. She shares the report with her manager so they can review it.

## Strategies for engaging with the cybersecurity community

You have learned a lot about the security field, from the origins of security and its importance to organizations around the world to recognizing security incidents and communicating with stakeholders. 
Security is a rapidly evolving industry, so it’s important to stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. This reading will focus on how to stay engaged with the cybersecurity community after completing this program.

### Security organizations and conferences

Attending security conferences and joining organizations gives you the opportunity to gain knowledge from seasoned professionals who are constantly seeking out new ways to improve on their security strategies and techniques.  

#### Find the right organization

What security organization should you join? This question depends on your specific interest in security. Are you someone who wants to focus on reacting to security incidents or preventing them from happening? Are you interested in forensic security or data logging? Do you have aspirations of being a CISO one day? It’s important to have a clear understanding of what your interests are before you narrow down your search for a cybersecurity organization or conference. 

#### Begin the search

Once you understand what your interests are, do a web search for organizations or conferences in your area. For example, you can type in “incident response cybersecurity conferences in my area.” This search will give you a list of cybersecurity conferences focused on incident response. If you’re interested in forensic security, you can type “forensic security organizations in my area” or a similar phrase into your web search engine. No matter what your interests are, you can do a web search online to find a cybersecurity organization or conference focused on that area.   

### Use social media

Social media is another great way to find cybersecurity organizations or conferences. LinkedIn®, for example, is a social media platform that connects business professionals with one another. You can use LinkedIn® to find security groups or organizations to join. In the LinkedIn® search bar, you can try search queries such as:
    • “Incident response cybersecurity groups” 
    •  “Organizations for cybersecurity analysts” 
 Be aware of social engineering 
While social media is a good way to connect with other professionals in the security industry, it’s also important to be mindful that hackers use social media to trick users into giving up private information. You've previously learned that social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. To protect yourself from social engineering when using social media to find resources, always remember not to click on unexpected links or attachments sent from unfamiliar users on social media.

### Mailing lists for security

Another great way to stay connected with the security industry is to sign up for different cybersecurity mailing lists. These mailing lists send out information periodically on various security topics. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers two cybersecurity mailing lists for you to join:
    • A list focused on security threat information, best practices for cybersecurity, and analysis from CISA’s domestic and international security partners
    • A list providing weekly summaries of new vulnerabilities that might pose a risk to an organization’s network

## Activity: Explore cybersecurity organizations

### Scenario

Review the following background information. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.
It’s a useful practice to find a security organization to join during the job searching process. Doing so will help you engage with the security community while you’re seeking employment. 
The first step in choosing a security organization you might like to join is to reflect on what areas in cybersecurity interest you most. After you’ve identified a few topics, the next step is to search for organizations related to those topics online. Once you’ve done research into a few different organizations that are relevant to your interests, it’s important to write what stood out to you and why. This will give you an opportunity to review your notes at a later time to help you determine which organizations most closely align well with the areas in cybersecurity that interests you the most

2. Write down your cybersecurity topics of interest
In Part 1 of the security organization worksheet, list your areas of interest in the cybersecurity profession. For example, these are some areas you might consider:
    • Raising security awareness
    • Protecting sensitive data
    • Cloud security
You can include at least three topics, but you may include more if you like.  Typically two or three topics is ideal. That way, you can keep focused on a specific aspect of the security field. 
Note: Think back to the different security topics throughout this certificate program such as cloud security, incident response, forensic security, etc. You can also review a summary of topics discussed in each course on the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate main page.

3. Identify three security organizations and highlight their objectives
Spend some time researching security organizations online. Use keywords of the interests you previously listed to help with your search. For example, "data encryption organizations," or "vulnerability management." Pay close attention to the objectives and goals of the organizations you research and try to identify ones that align with the interests you identified in Part 1 of the worksheet
Choose three organizations that align most closely with your interests. Then, add their names and brief descriptions (20-40 words) of their objectives to Part 2 of the worksheet.
Note: Consider the “about us” page on the organization’s website. That typically will have mission statements and areas of focus for the  organization.

4. Explain which organization fits your interest the most and why
In Part 3 of the security organization worksheet, write 1-2 sentences (20-40 words) explaining how each organization does (or does not) relate to your interests. Then, clearly identify one organization that most closely aligns with your interest and goals in cybersecurity. 
Note: Keep in mind that it's just as important to determine which organization does not fit your needs as much as it is to determine the organization that does fit your needs. Even though an organization may match your professional interests, it does not necessarily mean that organization is a good match for what you’re looking for. 

#### Completed

Security organization worksheet exemplar

Part 1: Describe your security interests

    • Cloud computing security
    • Incident response 
    • Protection of sensitive data
    • Raising security awareness

Part 2: Identify three organizations and include their mission or objectives
    • Organization 1:  CSA - Cloud Security Alliance

## Connect with other cybersecurity professionals

You’ve learned the importance of staying engaged with the cybersecurity community after completing this certificate program. The security industry is always evolving, so it’s important that security professionals continue to learn about the field.
This reading will focus on providing more tips to help you stay engaged with the security community and advance your career by engaging with the cybersecurity community. 

### LinkedIn® with CISOs

Earlier in the program, you learned about Chief Information Security Officers, also known as CISOs.  It’s their job to be up-to-date on every aspect of security, including all of the latest trends and news in the security world. With this in mind, it’s a great idea to follow CISOs on LinkedIn® professional networking services. When you follow a CISO on social media, you’ll have an opportunity to discover the kinds of information they share with their audience. That information might provide you with useful tips and relevant news. Staying informed about security news and trends can help progress your cybersecurity career because it helps sharpen your security mindset.

### Finding other security professionals on LinkedIn®

Whether you’d like to connect with other entry-level analysts or more seasoned professionals, LinkedIn® is a great way to connect with others. When connecting with others, it’s important to send a well-written message. This message can help the person understand your intentions. It also helps people determine that you’re not a scammer looking to exploit them. Here are a few tips to help you write your first message in a way that engages and interests the recipient: 
    • Use a conversational tone.
    • Provide a clear reason for wanting to connect.
    • Avoid spelling and grammatical errors.
Here is an example of an effective LinkedIn® message to send to a security professional: 
“Hi, Tim. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, and I’d like to connect with other security professionals. It seems like you have a lot of experience in the security industry that I can learn from. Let’s keep in touch!” 
This example provides a clear reason for why you want to connect with this person and is presented in a conversational tone. You also did not give the impression that you are a scammer by asking the person to do something suspicious to connect with you, like downloading an unusual file attachment.

## Tips for finding and applying for a job

As you learned previously, connecting with security professionals on social media and joining different cybersecurity conferences and organizations are two ways to use your network to find job opportunities. You were also introduced to a few online resources to help you find jobs in the security field. In this reading, you’ll learn about specific sites and resources you can use to apply for jobs.

### ZipRecruiter

ZipRecruiter is a popular website for job seekers and employers worldwide; the website helps connect job seekers with available roles in their industry. When you enter the site, you’re asked to fill out specific geographical and work preference questions to help ZipRecruiter match you with opportunities in your field. Then you can upload your resume on the platform and search for jobs in your industry. Employers can reach out to you directly, too, based on your profile and responses.

### Indeed

Indeed is another popular website that helps connect job seekers with available roles in their industry. When you first enter the site, search for jobs using the job title, a keyword, or a company that you’re interested in working at. Then, specify your preferred job location. You can also upload your resume on Indeed, which allows recruiters to reach out to you if your resume is a match for a job opportunity.

### Monster®

Monster is a frequently used website in both the United States and internationally that helps connect job seekers with available roles in their industry. Similar to the other job search sites, search for a role using the job title, keyword, or company you’re interested in working at, as well as your preferred working location. If you upload your resume to Monster, recruiters might reach out to you if your resume is a match for a job opportunity. 

### LinkedIn®

LinkedIn® professional services is a social networking site where you can also find jobs in the cybersecurity field. When you first enter LinkedIn®, click on the “jobs” tab. From here, enter the location where you’d want to work and the particular job title that you’d be interested in. LinkedIn is also a great way to learn about a company's culture, values, and even community initiatives. This can help you determine if the company is the right fit for you.

## Portfolio Activity: Create or update a resume

### Scenario

Your resume gives potential employers a first impression of you and your qualifications. To prepare for your search for roles in cybersecurity, you will need to create a new resume or update your current one to reflect the skills and experiences you have gained from this program. First, you will search for and identify a target role. Then, as you craft your resume, you will tailor the content to match the requirements for that role.
Note: Crafting a strong resume is challenging and can take some time. For now, you should at least complete steps 1-6 of the activity, but feel free to finish the remainder of the steps later if you need more time. You will need to finish steps 1-9 to answer all of the questions at the end of this activity. 
Step-By-Step Instructions

1. Select a resume template
The formatting elements provided in a template—such as the layout and headings—are a helpful starting point when creating a new resume.
To select a template for your resume, open the template gallery in Google Docs or another word processing application. Go to the resumes section and examine the templates. Choose one template for your resume, and open it. Rename the document “Resume [Your Name].”
Alternatively, if you already have a resume that you’d like to update, open that document instead.

2. Research cybersecurity roles
Think about what you’ve learned about cybersecurity roles in this program so far, and decide which type of role you would like to pursue. Consider the tasks and responsibilities that interest you, your current skill set, and your previous experience. Then, research roles on platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn™ Job Search, and/or CareerBuilder, and identify a position that appeals to you.

3. Take notes on your research
Add a blank page to the bottom of your resume document, or open a new document to take notes on your findings. Then, record the job title of the role you selected from your search, as well as some of the qualifications and skills required for that position. Read several additional job descriptions for similar roles to identify qualifications and skills that show up frequently, and note those as well.

4. Add your contact information
In the resume, add your contact information at the top of the document. Include the following information:
    • Your name
    • Location (such as city and state)
    • Phone number
    • Email address
    • (Optional) the URL to your LinkedIn profile
Next, add a job title near your contact information that conveys both your current experience and the role you are seeking. For example, you might add “Incident Response Analyst” or “Data Forensics Analyst.” You can also add something more broad, such as “Cybersecurity Analyst.”
Pro tip: Your email address should be easy to read, relatively short. It should also avoid too many words or symbols that are unrelated to your name. You may need to create a new email address if your current one doesn't fit these requirements.

5. Add your skills
Review the notes you took in Step 3 to help you fill in the Skills section of your resume. Include skills that align closely with the requirements for the position you identified. These might include skills you've learned in this program or ones you've gained in previous positions, such as:
    • Python and data logging 
    • Communicating with stakeholders
    • Attention to detail
To organize this section, format your skills as a bulleted list in two or more columns. You can also split different types of skills into different sections, based on the requirements of the role.
Pro tip: Match the language that was used by the potential employer when possible since some employers use automation software to filter resumes. For example, if the job description uses words like “problem-solving” and “critical thinking,” use those words in your resume, too.

6. Add your experience
The Experience section of your resume provides a summary of the positions you have held in your career. List at least three positions in reverse chronological order. This can include volunteer roles and other relevant experience. Each listing should include:
    • Company name
    • Location
    • Job title
    • Dates you worked there. (If you are still working there, write your start date, a hyphen, and then “Present.”)
    • A short description or bulleted list of your responsibilities 
Focus on showcasing only your best and most relevant responsibilities or accomplishments. Your resume doesn’t need to include every detail from every job you've held. Once you get an interview, you can go into more details about yourself.
Follow these best practices when adding to your Experience descriptions:
    • Use active verbs like developed, coordinated, created, planned, built, tracked, managed, and monitored to describe the tasks you performed. 
    • When possible, quantify the tasks you performed by including numbers. (For example, “Collaborate with over 10 departments to ensure synchronization across the organization.”)
    • Write in the present tense for work you still do, and use the past tense for a job or project that you completed. 
    • Aim to communicate how your skills and past accomplishments relate to the role you are applying for.

7. Add your education
The Education section of your resume describes any formal schooling and training you’ve had. Listing your education helps demonstrate the qualifications and knowledge you bring to a potential employer and shows that you meet the requirements for the opportunity you are seeking. 
Fill in the name of any school you attended after high school; its location; the degree, diploma, or certificate you earned; and the dates that you attended. Begin with your most recent school first. Also, include any internships, apprenticeships, professional certifications, or credentials you hold. For example, you might include:
Google Career Certificate in Cybersecurity - Online certificate
MAY 20XX - OCTOBER 20XX
Note: If you’re currently enrolled in school and have not yet earned a degree or certification, write “In Progress” instead of the end date.

8. Add what makes you unique 
Complete your resume with a section that further makes you stand out to potential employers. There are many approaches to communicating what makes you unique from other applicants.
For example, you can keep the existing Awards section (if using a Google Docs resume template) and list any awards you have received. Similar to the formatting used in Step 7, include who awarded them to you, and the date you received them.
Alternatively, you can replace this section with a section like “Languages,” “Software,” “Volunteer Work,” “Projects,” “Hobbies and Interests,” or “Accomplishments.”
Pro tip: Tailor the section whenever possible to match unique characteristics of the role. For example, if the employer is seeking someone who is multilingual and you speak several languages, add a “Languages" section to highlight your skills.

9. Proofread your resume
It's critical to carefully proofread your resume for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. Correcting any mistakes demonstrates your attention to detail.
Make sure your resume is as concise as possible. Ideally, the length of your resume should be no more than one or two pages, particularly early on in your career. If there are places where you can use fewer words to say the same thing, choose a more precise word or concise phrasing.
Pro tip: Closely read every section yourself or ask a friend to review your resume and provide feedback. Spelling and grammar checking tools are helpful, but they can miss mistakes.

## The interview process

You previously learned how to create a resume and cover letter to apply for security jobs. In this reading, you’ll concentrate on how to prepare for the interview process. Although the interview process can vary widely from one company to another, most companies follow the steps described in this reading.

### Getting contacted by a recruiter

After you apply for a job, you might receive a call, an email, or a message from a recruiter expressing interest in your application and asking to schedule a call or meeting. Reply as soon as possible to show that you’re responsive and interested in the position.

### Preliminary interview or phone screening

In most cases, the first step in the interview process is a preliminary interview, sometimes referred to as a phone screening. This usually involves a conversation with a recruiter over the phone, in person, or on a video call.
The preliminary interview is typically shorter than a regular interview. The recruiter will share information about the company and the job opening. Then they’ll ask you questions to get to know you and your work experience better. The recruiter will also provide time for you to ask questions about the role and the company, so be sure to prepare a few questions before the interview. For example, you might ask: “What is the work culture like at the company?” or “What will my average day be like in this role?” Asking questions helps demonstrate your interest and will help you determine whether the job will be a good fit for you. 
After the interview, send a thank-you email to the recruiter within 24 hours. Express your gratitude for their time and briefly restate why you would be a good fit for the position.

### Additional interviews

Once you’ve passed the preliminary interview, you might be invited for multiple additional interviews. These interviews are typically with the hiring manager. You might also meet with other individuals on the team and be required to go through a technical interview. You’ll learn more about technical interviews in a later reading.
This interview is often longer than the preliminary interview. It could be in person, over the phone, or on a video call.
The interview usually opens with introductions and a brief description of the company and job position. Then, the interviewer will ask you questions about your background, skills, and experience. Next, you’ll have an opportunity to ask questions about the company, the role, and job expectations.
Finally, you’ll learn about next steps in the hiring process.
There might be multiple rounds of interviews, depending on how the company’s interview process works. These additional interviews could be longer, include future teammates or other employees at the company, and feature questions that take more time and thought to answer.
As with the preliminary interview, send a thank-you note to the people you interviewed with after each round of interviews. 

### Final offer

Now comes the exciting part: Receiving a job offer. The company might reach out to you by phone or email. After the company extends their initial offer, you’ll need to decide whether or not to accept it or negotiate for a higher salary or other benefits. Feel free to ask for a day or two to make your decision.
Building perseverance
If the company lets you know that you didn’t get the job, take a moment to process your emotions. If you’d like, you can let the company know that you appreciate the opportunity to be considered and that you’d be interested in any future roles that might be a good fit. You can also ask for feedback on what you could do better next time.

## Prepare for technical interviews

You previously learned about the interview process, which generally consists of an introductory interview, a second interview with a hiring manager, and a panel interview. In this reading, you’ll focus more on the technical interviews that take place during the interview process. Although technical interviews can vary from one company to another, the concepts covered in this reading will help prepare you for any technical interview.

### What are technical interviews?

After you’ve applied for a job in cybersecurity and receive interest from a recruiter, you might be invited to an introductory interview, a second interview with a hiring manager, and a panel interview. Additionally, you might be asked to participate in a technical interview. The main difference between technical interviews and other interviews is the focus on required knowledge of specific tools.

### Python

Python is a programming language that serves as an important tool in security, and you might be asked about it during a technical interview. It will be important to mention your basic knowledge of Python. You might recall from this program that Python is popular for its ease of use as well as its extensive libraries and integrations. It can be applied to various security tasks that require automation. During your interview, you might be asked to whiteboard a pseudo code in Python. Being able to confidently use Python terminology during an interview can help you stand out as a potential candidate. This will let the interviewer know that you have a solid understanding of what Python is and what it can be used for.

### General techniques

During your technical interview, you might be expected to demonstrate basic knowledge of various general security concepts. For example, you might need to show familiarity with security frameworks, which are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. When discussing security frameworks, it would be helpful to mention your knowledge of specific NIST frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Another technical concept for you to discuss during a technical interview is network security. You might recall that network security is the practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. Reviewing the different technical concepts you’ve learned throughout this program is a good way to prepare for a technical interview. It will sharpen your skills and help you leave a good impression on the interviewer. 
Additionally, it may be a good idea to write the entire question down on paper before answering. Often, technical interview questions have multiple parts to cover. People sometimes rush to give an answer and show their knowledge but not fully cover everything that the question asks. Writing down the question can help you ensure you have the question right and are able to provide a structured response. 

### Possible technical interview questions

Every technical interview will be different, depending on the company and the interviewers. But here are a few possible technical interview questions to help you prepare: 
    • What is the TCP/IP model? 
The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. 
    • What is the OSI model?
The OSI model stands for open systems interconnection (OSI) model. It is a standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network. 
    • What are SIEM tools and what are they used for? 
SIEM tools are security information and event management tools that are used by security professionals to identify and analyze security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

## Apply the STAR method during interviews

You’ve been learning about different techniques and strategies to use during future interviews for jobs in the cybersecurity field. In this reading, you’ll learn more details about the STAR method for answering interview questions. Implementing this strategy will help you answer interview questions with confidence and clarity.

### The STAR method

When interviewing for a job, it can be challenging to convey the right details about your professional history and skills to your interviewers. Using the STAR method can help you share your success stories effectively and strategically. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Using this method enables you to describe potential challenges you faced in previous roles and gives you the opportunity to show how you thoughtfully approached solving those problems from start to finish. 

### Situation

The situation is the project you worked on or a challenge that you had to overcome. For example, perhaps you had to manage a disgruntled customer’s negative feedback about your company,  a system error on your work device that slowed down a customer transaction, or being left alone in the office for an extended period of time. Fully describing the situation allows the interviewer to gain a clear understanding of the challenge you had to overcome.  

### Task

The task outlines the key responsibilities or role you played in solving the challenge described in the situation phase of the STAR method. Specifying what the task is provides clarity about what your objectives were in this scenario.

### Action
The action describes the exact steps you took to resolve the challenging situation you described in the beginning of the STAR method. The action is crucial to the STAR method because it allows the employer to understand what choices you made to achieve your desired outcome during a real conflict or challenge. Employers want employees who can think fast and make decisions that help solve problems. 

### Result

Finally, sharing the result of your challenge or example shows the employers how the situation was resolved as a direct result of the actions you took. When participating in an interview, you want to make sure that any example you give with the STAR method ends in a positive result. Positive results show an employer that you are someone who has demonstrated an ability to successfully resolve issues and may lead an employer to offer you a job. Of course, not all situations have completely positive outcomes; if an employer asks you about a situation that didn’t have a positive outcome, try to focus on what you learned from the situation and how that experience helped you become a better employee.

## Activity: Use the STAR method to answer interview questions

### Scenario

Review the following information. Then complete the step-by-step instructions. 
When you use the STAR method to answer behavioral interview questions during an interview, interviewers get a better sense of who you are as a candidate and why you’ve applied for the role. The STAR method can make your responses easier for them to follow by creating a logical structure to each story you share. Preparing and practicing responses using the STAR method in advance can also help you feel more confident going into an interview. 
In this activity, you will prepare responses to two common behavioral interview questions. First, you will recall and record notes about experiences you’ve had in the past that demonstrate your key skills. Then, you will select two questions from a list of behavioral questions frequently asked during interviews. You will answer each of these questions using the STAR method. Finally, you have the option to practice answering these questions and others aloud in front of a mirror, friend, or family member.

2. Identify experiences that demonstrate your skills
Research the most commonly sought skills cybersecurity analysts have by reviewing job descriptions on platforms like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [LinkedIn™ Job Search](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), and/or [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com/). Then, consider the experiences you’ve had that demonstrate those types of skills. These may be past work experiences, school projects, volunteer positions, or any other relevant activities you’ve done—even the completion of this program. 
Add notes on at least three of those experiences to the Experiences that demonstrate my skills section of the STAR responses worksheet.

3. Select interview questions
During a job interview, you may be asked behavioral interview questions. Your answers to these questions should demonstrate how you handled a specific situation in the past and indicate how you might handle a similar situation in the future. 
Review the list of Common Behavioral Interview Questions for Cybersecurity Analysts on the second page of the STAR responses worksheet.
Consider which two questions would allow you to describe the experiences you recorded in Step 2. Then, copy the two questions and paste them in the Question 1 and Question 2 sections of the template.

4. Describe the situation
The STAR method can help you organize your responses in a story-like structure. 

5. Describe your task
In the Task section, add 1-2 sentences that relate the situation to a task that you were required to complete.
For example, describe what you were asked to do, how you were involved, or what you were responsible for. Try your best to explain exactly how you fit into the story you’re telling.

6. Explain the actions you took
The action section of the STAR method is your chance to highlight your role in solving the problem for your interviewer. 
Complete the Action section of Question 1 by writing a short paragraph (2-4 sentences) that describe the action(s) you took to accomplish the task. Give specific details that demonstrate your abilities and skills. This part of your response may take the most time to cover, since you can highlight multiple skills here.

7. Share your results
Finally, it's time to share the conclusion of your story by summarizing what you achieved. 
In the Results section of Question 1, add a short paragraph (2-4 sentences) describing the outcome of the actions you took and the impact you had. When possible, use data—such as numbers and percentages—to reinforce your response. If you’re sharing an experience that came with challenges, you may also want to share the lessons you learned.

8. Answer the second question
Repeat steps 4–7 to answer Question 2 using the STAR method.

STAR Responses
Experiences that demonstrate my skills:
1. Helped Nice Touch Healthcare group strengthen their security posture
through adherence to industry standard policies and procedures.
2. Maintained effective communications with various teams across the
organization to ensure overall alignment on security best practices.
3. Completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, demonstrating my
eagerness to learn and grow my knowledge and skill set.
Question 1: Tell me about a time you had to work across various internal
teams on security tasks. How did you plan and arrange appropriate times to
meet and mutually acceptable timelines across these teams? What was the
outcome?
Situation When I was a Cybersecurity Junior Analyst at Nice Touch
Healthcare Group, the organization was experiencing a
tremendous increase in employees clicking on phishing email
links. The security team determined that various department
leaders were not educating their employees on the importance
of not clicking every link and attachment found in an email.

Task I was part of a team tasked with identifying which departments
were clicking on the most phishing links and communicating
those findings to the leaders of those departments.

Action I went into our organization’s work calendar to find available
times to meet with more senior-level analysts to discuss the
phishing data they gathered. We discussed the impact of the
data and the need for me to put that data into a visual
presentation. After I created bar charts for the phishing data, I
reached out to the assistants of the various department leaders
via email to establish the best date and time for my team and
those leaders to join a video call to discuss the data. We came
up with a plan to minimize the amount of phishing emails being
clicked on by launching an employee awareness campaign and
set a timeline to complete the plan by end of year.

Result The organization saw a 20% decrease in the amount of phishing

links clicked on by employees one month after my team and I
met with all of the department leaders.

Question 2: Describe an experience in which you had to create, develop,
and/or maintain documentation related to security processes and procedures.
How did you plan, execute and maintain these documents?
Situation When I first started working at Nice Touch Healthcare Group,
the organization was working on establishing its third-party
assessment program. The purpose of the program was to
properly assess the security of all third-party companies we did
business with to ensure those companies did not have major
security vulnerabilities that could negatively impact our
organization.

Task After working at Nice Touch for a year, I was put in charge of
managing any updates or changes to the third-party
assessment program procedures and policies..

Action I was granted access to a shared drive that contained the
third-party assessment policies and procedures. From there, I
did an audit of the individuals who currently had access to that
shared folder. I found that a few employees who were either no
longer working for the company or no longer working with the
third-party assessment team still had access to the shared
folder. I mentioned this to my direct supervisor and was given
permission to remove those individuals’ access to the shared
folder. From there, I set up weekly meetings with other
members of the third-party assessment team to discuss any
new changes or adjustments that needed to be made to the
policies and procedures. I also periodically added or removed
individuals’ access to the shared folder as needed.

Result Executives mentioned the third-party assessment program in
the end-of-year functional review meeting. The executives
remarked that they appreciated how much more streamlined
and collaborative the third-party program had become after I
began maintaining the documentation.

## Prepare for interviews

Great news! You’ve submitted your application and received a follow-up email requesting an interview.  The work isn’t over yet, though—you still have a lot of preparation to do. That’s what you’re going to learn about in this reading!

### Prepare for the introductory call

It’s important to showcase your best self in the introductory phone call. In this conversation, you’ll talk with the recruiter or hiring manager about yourself, the kind of work or training you have, and why you want the job. You might also be asked specifically about your salary requirements. For this question, it’s a good idea to prepare in advance and conduct an internet search for “average salary for entry-level security analysts.” 

### Do your research

Make sure you’ve done your research on the company. When the interviewer asks why you’d be a good fit for the job, they want to learn why you’re interested in cybersecurity and why you want to work at that company specifically. 

### Prepare for the second round

Your second-round interview will focus more on what you can offer as an entry-level security analyst. You’ll likely discuss yourself here, too, but you’ll also be going into detail about your knowledge of the profession. You’ll want to cover the same material you prepared for your introductory call, but you’ll also need to fully review your accomplishments in the security industry. Don’t worry if you have no prior professional cybersecurity experience. You can discuss the information you’ve learned in this certificate program. 
Depending on where you and your interviewer are located, the second-round interview might be over the phone, via video conference, or in person. In-person interviews often last an hour or so, but if you traveled for your interview or the company likes to bring candidates in for all of the remaining interview stages at once, you might complete your panel interview with a group that day as well.

### Panel interview

During the panel interview, you’ll meet with two or more people and discuss yourself and your ability to contribute to the organization. If you’re nervous about this, remind yourself that the team brought you in for the interview for a reason. When you feel confident in your abilities, you’re better able to showcase your knowledge about the security industry and demonstrate your ability to work well with a team. 
Be sure to engage with each panelist by giving them your full attention during the interview. Maintaining eye contact can help you express confidence, but for those who cannot do so, actively engaging with each panelist in your own way is just as important. 
It’s likely that each panelist will ask you at least one question during the interview. It’s okay to address the whole panel when answering a question, rather than only directing your response to the person who asked the question. 

### More resources to help you prepare

There’s an endless supply of job-preparation resources available to you. Here are some great ones to get you started:
    • [Interview tips from Google](https://careers.google.com/interview-tips/?src=Online%2FSocial%2FNewYearNewJob&utm_campaign=&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Online). This resource from the Google Careers team provides best practices and advice on how to prepare and ace your interviews at Google, but of course these tips will work at any company!
    • [Interviewing techniques for persons with disabilities](https://askjan.org/publications/consultants-corner/vol01iss13.cfm). This resource from the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) offers helpful advice on navigating the interview process for individuals with disabilities.

## Learn more about developing an elevator pitch

When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a security professional, and what qualities you’re searching for in a potential job. A simple way to deliver this information succinctly is with an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a brief summary of your experience, skills, and background that should be communicated in 60 seconds or fewer.
Although an elevator pitch is often specific to an idea or a product, you can also use it to sell yourself as a professional to potential employers. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch can be used to stand out to your interviewer. It can be used to help explain why you’re a good fit for the role or to answer the popular interview question “tell me about yourself.” This reading helps you prepare your elevator pitch to express the value you can provide as an entry-level security analyst or a more experienced cybersecurity professional. 

### Provide an introduction

Start by providing an introduction. Introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first job in security, mention some of your past roles and skills used for those roles that can translate to success in the security field. Some of these skills can include attention to detail, goal-orientedness, and good collaboration skills.

### Describe your career interests and transferable skills

Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in security, it’s important to clarify that this is your desired career. For example, you could say, “I want to apply my excellent skills for collaborating with others, and my attention to detail, to help the security team protect company data and assets.” To determine which transferable skills to highlight in your elevator pitch, consider ones that you have already developed and how they might apply to your goals as a security professional, such as problem-solving, communication, and time management. 

### Express your excitement

This is where you share your passion for the field and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to help an organization defend itself against hackers, mention that. This is also a good time to talk about your goals. 
For example, you could say, “I love security because it gives me the opportunity to safeguard valuable information from malicious actors attempting to cause unnecessary harm to people and organizations. Long term, I’d love to develop a security and hacker mindset to play my part in defending against the constantly evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.”

### Communicate your interest in the company

Communicating why you are interested in the company—and not just the role—is a great way to help the interviewer recognize that you are knowledgeable about the company. This helps you to establish a rapport with the interviewer and shows that you’ve done your due diligence before coming to the interview. 
For example, if you were interviewing for a position for Google’s security team, you could say, “Being a member of Google’s security team helps protect millions of people’s private and sensitive information. As a long-time Google products user, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be able to help safeguard those products and ensure customers have the best experience possible.”

Begin by searching for roles on platforms like [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/), [linkedin.com/jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), or [careerbuilder.com](https://www.careerbuilder.com/). You can search for cybersecurity titles like, but not limited to, Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst or SOC Analyst. 
Pro tip: You can also use the criteria you noted in the Job Search Criteria section of the elevator pitch template to filter for specific jobs. 
When you identify a role that appeals to you, add its title and the company’s name to the Role section of the elevator pitch template.

4. Record your relevant experience and skills
Review the job description for the role you identified in Step 2. Think about how the experience, responsibilities, and skills required for the position align with your own experience and skill set. 
Consider experience or skills you gained from previous jobs, school, this program, volunteer work, and even your personal life. Record at least 2-3 relevant experiences and skills in the Relevant Experience and Skills section of the template. 

5. Record information about the company
Describe what they do and what their mission is. You may find this information in the job description itself, or you might need to navigate to the company’s website. Read what others have to say about the company, as well.Conduct some pre-interview research about the company that is hiring for the role that you identified. 
Consider the following details while reviewing their information:
    • What's their mission?
    • What industry are they in?
    • Are they a new company?
You might find this information in the job description itself. Then, record 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) describing your findings in the Company Description section of the template. Note anything about the company that you find particularly interesting.

6. Start your pitch with an introduction
In the steps that follow, you'll draft an elevator pitch in the Elevator Pitch section of the template. 
Start with an introduction of 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that includes your name and provides a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first job in cybersecurity, mention some of your previous jobs that had relatable or transferable skills.

7. Express your interest in the role
In an elevator pitch, it’s important to get to the point as quickly as possible. Write 1-2 sentences (20-40 words) explaining why the role interests you and why you want to work in the industry.

8. Describe your relevant experience and skills
Next, review the relevant experience and skills you recorded in Step 3. In 2-4 sentences (40-80 words), highlight your experience and skills to communicate the value you would bring to the position. Describe the strengths you have that make you a good fit for the role. Consider mentioning your completion of this certificate program and other relevant coursework. And, if applicable, describe a particular project you worked on that relates to the requirements for the role. 

9. Communicate your interest in the company
Communicating why you are interested in the company helps show the interviewer that you are knowledgeable about the company and not just the role. Refer to the description of the company you recorded in Step 3. Then, write 1-2 sentences (20-40 words) indicating that you understand the company’s mission and expressing your desire to work for them. 

10. Proofread and revise your draft
Once you’re done with your first draft, proofread and revise it. Set a timer and read your draft out loud to check if it fits within the 30–60 second limit. While checking to see it fits within that time frame, it’s also important not to talk too quickly. Talking too fast can make your elevator pitch hard to understand. If necessary, edit it down. Remember, you want to be able to quickly deliver your elevator pitch and capture your audience’s attention. Reading your pitch out loud can also help you identify any awkward phrasing and refine your writing.

## Tips for interviewing remotely

A remote interview is an interview conducted virtually using video platform software. This type of interview provides an opportunity to connect with hiring managers and recruiters, even if you are not able to meet with them in person. Remote interviews also present challenges that in-person interviews do not, such as issues related to technology, lighting, and sound.
In this reading, you will learn tips to successfully prepare for a remote interview.

### Test your technology

The first tip is to test the technology you’ll be using for the video. Different companies use different video platform software to host their remote interviews. Typically, the recruiter or hiring manager will reach out to you over the phone or email to share information about which software will be used for the interview.
Once you find out which software the company you’re interviewing with uses, you should download that software, if you don't have it already. Next, it's important to test your computer’s camera and microphone to ensure they work well with the video platform software a day or two before the interview. This allows you to resolve any technical issues you might have.  Be mindful of how to mute and unmute your microphone, just in case there is noise in your environment that you do not want the interviewer to hear. It’s also important to talk with the recruiter or hiring manager about a backup plan if the technology does not cooperate when it's time for the interview.
You’ll also want to test any technologies you need to use to ensure you are ready to interview, such as the closed caption feature on the app. Employers are typically happy to accommodate your needs if you're using assistive technology or need specific accommodations. If your internet service is not fast enough to allow for a video interview, you can request a phone interview instead.

### Practice communicating through video

Communicating through video can be a challenge because there is a slight sound delay. The sound delay can make it difficult to know how long to wait for someone to stop speaking and for you to start. If you don’t have experience communicating through video, consider practicing with friends and family before the remote interview. This will help you learn how pauses affect video communication.
Create a professional background
Review your video background before the interview. Typically, you should avoid having an unorganized background or any objects that might distract the interviewer. When interviewing remotely, ensure that your area is well lit. You might want to rearrange your desk or furniture to ensure good lighting.
Always try to have light behind your camera so that it will shine on your face. If you can’t position your desk next to a window or don’t have enough light coming from the window, consider using artificial light. 
Additionally, you should do your best to limit background noise and use a headset, if possible. 

### Dress appropriately

It’s a good idea to research the company you’re interviewing with to determine which type of interview outfit is suitable. You might need to wear formal business attire during your remote interview for a particular role and company, whereas for another position, more casual clothing might be appropriate. Typically, it is better to overdress than to underdress, especially for more traditional businesses. 
Look at the interviewer when speaking
When communicating through video, try to look at the interviewer when speaking instead of at the camera. Looking at the interviewer can give them the feeling that you’re engaged in the conversation and focused on what they’re saying. 

### Sign in early

Before the interview, test your technology. This will help you feel confident that everything will work. However, technology and software can be unpredictable. If possible, sign in to your remote interview early to ensure everything is working properly.
Signing in early also indicates to your interviewer that you respect their time and are a punctual person.
