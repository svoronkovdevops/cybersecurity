## Job responsibilities of an entry-level security analyst

Are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

      Protecting computer and network systems requires an analyst to monitor an organization's internal network. If a threat is detected, then an analyst is generally
the first to respond. Analysts also often take part in exercises to search for weaknesses in an organization's own systems.
For example, a security analyst may contribute to penetration testing or ethical hacking. The goal is to penetrate or hack their own organization's
internal network to identify vulnerabilities and suggest ways to strengthen their security measures.

      Security analysts also proactively work to prevent threats from happening in the first place. One way they do this
is by working with information technology, or IT, teams to install prevention software for the purposes of identifying risks
and vulnerabilities. Analysts may also be involved in software and hardware development. They'll often work with development teams to support product
security by setting up appropriate processes and systems to meet the organization's data protection needs. 

      The last task we'll discuss is conducting periodic security audits. A security audit is a review of an organization's security records, activities, and other
related documents. For example, an analyst may examine in-house security issues, such as making sure that confidential information, like individual computer passwords, isn't available
to all employees. Phew, that was a lot to cover! But hopefully you have a general idea of what entry-level security analysts do on a day-to-day basis. 


    Security analysts are an important part of any organization. Their daily tasks protect small businesses, large companies, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. They also help to
ensure that the people served by those organizations remain safe.

## Transferable and technical cybersecurity skills

    Transferable skills are skills from other areas of study or practice that can apply to different careers. 
    
    Technical skills may apply to several professions, as well; however, they typically requireknowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies. 

Transferable skills include:

   - Communication: As a cybersecurity analyst, you will need to communicate and collaborate with others. Understanding others’ questions or concerns and communicating information clearly to individuals with technical and non-technical knowledge will help you mitigate security issues quickly. 

   - Problem-solving: One of your main tasks as a cybersecurity analyst will be to proactively identify and solve problems. You can do this by recognizing attack patterns, then determining the most efficient solution to minimize risk. Don't be afraid to take risks, and try new things. Also, understand that it's rare to find a perfect solution to a problem. You’ll likely need to compromise.

   - Time management: Having a heightened sense of urgency and prioritizing tasks appropriately is essential in the cybersecurity field. So, effective time management will help you minimize potential damage and risk to critical assets and data. Additionally, it will be important to prioritize tasks and stay focused on the most urgent issue.
   - Growth mindset: This is an evolving industry, so an important transferable skill is a willingness to learn. Technology moves fast, and that's a great thing! It doesn't mean you will need to learn it all, but it does mean that you’ll need to continue to learn throughout your career. Fortunately, you will be able to apply much of what you learn in this program to your ongoing professional development.

   - Diverse perspectives: The only way to go far is together. By having respect for each other and encouraging diverse perspectives and mutual respect, you’ll undoubtedly find multiple and better solutions to security problems. 

Technical skills include: 

   - Programming languages: By understanding how to use programming languages, cybersecurity analysts can automate tasks that would otherwise be very time consuming. Examples of tasks that programming can be used for include searching data to identify potential threats or organizing and analyzing information to identify patterns related to security issues. 

   - Security information and event management (SIEM) tools: SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, or records of events such as unusual login behavior, and support analysts’ ability to monitor critical activities in an organization. This helps cybersecurity professionals identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.

   - Intrusion detection systems (IDSs): Cybersecurity analysts use IDSs to monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusions. It’s important to become familiar with IDSs because they’re a key tool that every organization uses to protect assets and data. For example, you might use an IDS to monitor networks for signs of malicious activity, like unauthorized access to a network.

   - Threat landscape knowledge: Being aware of current trends related to threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies is vital. This knowledge allows security teams to build stronger defenses against threat actor tactics and techniques. By staying up to date on attack trends and patterns, security professionals are better able to recognize when new types of threats emerge such as a new ransomware variant. 

   - Incident response: Cybersecurity analysts need to be able to follow established policies and procedures to respond to incidents appropriately. For example, a security analyst might receive an alert about a possible malware attack, then follow the organization’s outlined procedures to start the incident response process. This could involve conducting an investigation to identify the root issue and establishing ways to remediate it.

## Organization's security

A data breach, for example, affects everyone that is associated with the organization. This is because data losses or leaks can affect an organization's reputation as well as the lives and reputations
of their users, clients, and customers. PII and SPII data are key assets that a threat actor will look for if an organization experiences a breach.

    Personally identifiable information, known as PII, is any information used to infer an individual's identity. PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information. 

    Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as SPII, is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. 
    
    If SPII is stolen, this has the potential to be significantly more damaging to an individual than if PII is stolen. 

When a person's identifiable information is compromised, leaked, or stolen, identity theft is the primary concern. Identity theft is the act of stealing personal information to commit fraud while impersonating a victim. And the primary objective of identity theft is financial gain.

  Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or
criminal exploitation. For example, requiring complex passwords to access sites and services improves confidentiality by making it much more difficult for a threat actor to compromise them. A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk.


Security protects against external and internal threats. 

 - An `external threat `is someone outside of the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks or devices. 
 
 - An `internal threat `comes from current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners. Often these internal threats are accidental, such as an employee clicking on a compromised link in an email. Other times, the internal actor intentionally engages in activities such as unauthorized data access or abusing systems for personal use.

    Experienced security professionals will help organizations mitigate or reduce the impact of threats like these. Security teams also ensure an organization meets regulatory compliance, or laws and guidelines, that require the implementation of specific security standards.

    Security teams also maintain and improve business productivity. By establishing a plan for business continuity, security teams allow people to do their jobs, even in the case of something
like a data breach. Being security conscious can also reduce expenses associated with risks, such as recovering from data loss or operational downtime, and potentially avoiding fines. The last benefit of
security that we'll discuss is maintaining brand trust.


job titles: 

- Security analyst or specialist
- Cybersecurity analyst or specialist
- Security operation center or SOC analyst
- Information security analyst.

## Common attacks and their effectiveness

 A `computer virus` is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. The virus attaches itself to programs or documents
on a computer, then spreads and infects one or more computers in a network. 

A `worm `is a type of computer virus that can duplicate and spread on its own without human involvement. 


Today, viruses are more commonly referred to as malware, which is software designed to harm devices or networks. Two examples of early malware attacks that we'll cover are the Brain virus and the Morris worm.  
 After the Morris worm, Computer Emergency Response Teams, known as CERTs®, were established to respond to computer security incidents. 

`malware `could spread through the internet, threat actors no longer needed to use physical disks to spread viruses. two notable attacks that relied on the internet: the LoveLetter attack and the Equifax breach. Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For You." When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the list and installed a program to collect
user information and passwords.  After the LoveLetter, attackers understood the power of social engineering. 
`Phishing `is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Now, let's discuss the Equifax breach. 

### Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 
Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- `Business Email Compromise (BEC): `A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

- `Spear phishing: `A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

- `Whaling: `A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

- `Vishing: `The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- `Smishing: `The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

### Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  
Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- `Viruses: `Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
    
- `Worms: `Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

- `Ransomware: `A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 
    
- `Spyware: `Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.


### Social Engineering

`Social engineering `is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 
Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- `Social media phishing: `A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- `Watering hole attack: `A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- `USB baiting: `A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 
    
- `Physical social engineering: `A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.


### Social engineering principles 

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.
Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

- Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

- Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

- Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

- Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.

- Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

 - Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

## CISSP 8 domains

    CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional 

`CISSP `has defined eight domains to organize the work of security professionals. It's important to understand that these domains are related and that gaps in one domain can result in negative
consequences to an entire organization. CISSP defines eight domains in total, and we'll discuss all eight between this video and the next. 

  `Security and risk management `focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law. For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

 `Asset security. `This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. When working with this domain,
security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information. 

 `Security architecture and engineering. `This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. As a security analyst, you may be
tasked with configuring a firewall. A firewall is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps
prevent attacks that could affect productivity. 

  `Communication and network security.` This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user
behavior within your organization. Imagine discovering that users are connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots. This could leave the organization and its employees vulnerable to attacks. To ensure communications are secure, you would create a network policy to prevent and mitigate exposure. 

  `Identity and access management. `Identity and access management focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as
networks and applications. Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a
security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings. 

  `Security assessment and testing. `This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and 
vulnerabilities. Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access. For example, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries. 

  `Security operations. `This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat. 
  
  `Software development security. `This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. If, for example, one of your partner teams is
creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.

## Determine the type of attack

### Password attack

A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:

- `Brute force`
- `Rainbow table`

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

### Social engineering attack

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are: 

- Phishing

- Smishing

- Vishing

- Spear phishing

- Whaling

- Social media phishing

- Business Email Compromise (BEC)

- Watering hole attack

- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting

- Physical social engineering

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.


### Physical attack

A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- Malicious USB cable

- Malicious flash drive

- Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

### Adversarial artificial intelligence

Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

### Supply-chain attack

A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.


### Cryptographic attack

A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:

- Birthday

- Collision

- Downgrade

## Understand attackers

### Threat actor types

#### Advanced persistent threats

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents


#### Insider threats

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Sabotage

- Corruption

- Espionage

- Unauthorized data access or leaks


#### Hacktivists

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include:

- Demonstrations

- Propaganda

- Social change campaigns

- Fame



### Hacker types



A `hacker `is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- `Authorized hackers `are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

- `Semi-authorized hackers `are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

- `Unauthorized hackers `are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
Note: There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including:

- To learn and enhance their hacking skills

- To seek revenge

- To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.
There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## The CIA triad 

 The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
 
  - `Confidentiality `means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. For example, strict access controls that define who should and should
not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe. 

  - `Integrity `means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from
being tampered with. 

  - `Availability `means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. Let's define a term that came up during our discussion of the CIA triad: asset. An asset is an item perceived as having
value to an organization. And value is determined by the cost associated with the asset in question. 


```txt
                      /\
    Confidentiality  /  \   Integrity
                    /____\
                 Availability

```

 A specific framework developed by the U.S.-based National Institute of Standards
and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework, also referred to as the `NIST CSF`. 

The `NIST Cybersecurity Framework `is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 

`The most dangerous threat actors to consider are disgruntled employees. `They are the most dangerous because they often have access to sensitive information and know where to find it. In order to reduce
this type of risk, security professionals would use the principle of availability, as well as organizational guidelines based on frameworks to ensure staff members can only access the data they need to
perform their jobs. 

[Content](#content)


## Ethical principles

Let's discuss ethical principles: confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws. 

`Confidentiality ` as a security professional, you'll encounter proprietary or private information, such as PII. It's your ethical duty to keep that information confidential and safe. For example, you may want to help out a coworker by providing computer system access outside of properly documented channels. However, this ethical violation can result in serious consequences, including reprimands, the loss of
your professional reputation, and legal repercussions for
both you and your friend. 

`Privacy protections. `Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. For example, imagine you receive a personal email after hours from your manager requesting
a colleague's home phone number. Your manager explains that they can't access the employee database at the moment, but they need to discuss an urgent matter with that person. As a security analyst, your role is to follow the policies and procedures of your company, which in this example, state that employee information is stored in a secure database and should never be accessed or shared in any other format. 

`Laws `are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. For example, consider a staff member at a hospital who has been trained to handle PII,
and SPII for compliance. The staff member has files with confidential data that should never be left unsupervised, but the staff member is late for a meeting. Instead of locking the files
in a designated area, the files are left on the staff member's desk, unsupervised. Upon the employee's return, the files are missing. The staff member has just violated multiple compliance regulations, and their actions were unethical and illegal, since their negligence has likely resulted in the loss of private patient and hospital data.

## Security frameworks

Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization
manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws. There are several security frameworks that may be used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks. The purpose of security frameworks include protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII, securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals. 

Frameworks have four core components and understanding them will allow you to better manage potential risks. 

`Identifying and documenting security goals.` For example, an organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.'s `General Data Protection Regulation`, also known as `GDPR`. GDPR is a data protection
law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data. A security analyst may be asked to identify and document areas where an organization is out of compliance with GDPR. 

`Setting guidelines to achieve security goals.` For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from
individual users. 

`Implementing strong security processes. `In the case of GDPR, a security analyst working for a social media company may help design procedures to ensure the organization complies with verified
user data requests. An example of this type of request is when a user attempts to update or delete their profile information. 

`Monitoring and communicating results. `As an example, you may monitor your organization's internal network and report a potential security issue affecting GDPR to your manager or
regulatory compliance officer. Now that we've introduced the four core components of security frameworks, let's tie them all together. 

Frameworks allow analysts to work alongside other members of the security team to document, implement, and use the policies and procedures that have been created. 

[Content](#content)

## Security controls

  `Security controls `are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce
the risk of data breaches. As a security analyst, you may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training. 


`The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) `is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.
Examples of frameworks include the `NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) `and t`he NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)`. 
In addition to the NIST CSF and NIST RMF, there are several other controls, frameworks, and compliance standards:

`The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission `- North American Electric Reliability Corporation (`FERC-NERC`)

`The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)`. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

`Center for Internet Security (CIS®)` is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks.

`General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)` is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. 

`Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)` PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. 

`The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)` is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 
    1. Privacy
    2. Security 
    3. Breach notification

`the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), `which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

`International Organization for Standardization (ISO)` was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders.

`System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)`

`The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) `auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

    • Associate
    • Supervisor
    • Manager
    • Executive
    • Vendor 
    • Others

## Tools

[Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

Organizations use a variety of tools, such as SIEMs, playbooks, and packet sniffers to better manage, monitor, and analyze security threats. 
`Linux `is an open-source, or publicly available, operating system. Unlike other operating systems you may be familiar with, for example MacOS or Windows, Linux relies on a command line as the primary user interface. Linux itself is not a programming language, but it does allow for the use of text-based commands between the user and the operating system. 
`SQL `stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. A database is an organized collection of information or data.  
Security professionals can use `Python` to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming and that require a high level of detail and accuracy. As a future analyst, it's important to
understand that every organization's toolkit may be somewhat different based on their security needs.


A `log `is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Examples of security-related logs include records of employees signing into their computers or accessing web-based services. Logs help security professionals identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches. 

 A `SIEM tool `is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information, and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches as they happen. Imagine having to read pages and pages of logs to determine if there are any security threats. Depending on the amount of data, it could take hours or days. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of risks and threats. 
Commonly used SIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle. 

`Splunk ` is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data. 

`Chronicle `is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features. Both of these SIEM tools,
and SIEMs in general, collect data from multiple places, then analyze and filter that data to allow security teams to prevent and quickly react to potential security threats. 

Other key tools  are `playbooks and network protocol analyzers`. 

A `playbook `is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to an incident. Playbooks, which vary from one organization to the next, guide analysts in how to handle a security incident before, during, and after it has occurred. Playbooks can pertain to security or compliance reviews, access management, and many other organizational tasks that require a documented process
from beginning to end. 

Another tool is a `network protocol analyzer, `also called `packet sniffer`. A packet sniffer is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Common network protocol analyzers include `tcpdump `and `Wireshark. `

A `web vulnerability `is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.

`Antivirus software `is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.

`An intrusion detection system (IDS) `is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.

`Encryption `makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption. 
Note: Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information. 

`Penetration testing, `also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.
